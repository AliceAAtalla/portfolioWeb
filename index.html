    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Alice, born in Campo Grande - MS, recent resident in SÃ£o Paulo - SP,
        I'm 21 years old and very willing to learn!
        <br><br>
        I am a person passionate about technology and the financial market, 
        and in recent years, this passion has turned into motivation.
    <br><br>
        I am looking to reposition myself in the job market in a new career,
         and that is precisely why I started my studies at Trybe.
        Both because of my passion and because I believe in this startup, 
        which is revolutionizing the technology and education market, 
        today I am among one of the students of Software Development at that startup.
    <br><br>
        Despite all the challenges, which involve major changes and professional area, 
        I believe in my effort, to be a future Software Developer and make my work have
        an impact and relevance in other people's lives.
